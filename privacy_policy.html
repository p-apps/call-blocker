    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 24, 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>At a Glance: Our Zero-Data Promise</h2>
        <p><strong>Call Blocker does not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal data.</strong> Your information stays exclusively on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. Therefore, Call Blocker is built from the ground up to operate without collecting any user data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We <strong>do not</strong> collect your phone numbers, contacts, or call history.</li>
        <li>We <strong>do not</strong> track your location, device identifiers, or usage analytics.</li>
        <li>We <strong>do not</strong> transmit any information from your device to the developer, our servers, or any third party.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance</h2>
    <p>Because the Call Blocker application does not process, collect, or store any personal data whatsoever, no data subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or similar privacy legislation (such as CCPA) is ever collected by our application. You are always the sole owner and controller of your data.</p>

    <h2>3. Cloud Backups (iCloud)</h2>
    <p>Call Blocker offers you the ability to save customized blocklists so you do not lose your personalized configurations. If you choose to use the backup feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Backups are strictly manual and must be explicitly triggered by you.</li>
        <li>This data is backed up securely to your personal Apple iCloud account using Apple's native frameworks.</li>
        <li><strong>We, the developers, have absolutely no access to this iCloud backup data.</strong> Only you have access to it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Blocklist Updates</h2>
    <p>To avoid unwanted network traffic and tracking, updates to the open-source country-specific blocklists are initiated completely manually by you. When you refresh a blocklist, the app securely fetches the open-source JSON file from our public GitHub repository. This request is anonymous and no personal identifier is included.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to clarify our practices or reflect any new requirements. Because we have no way to contact you (since we collect no data), we recommend checking this page periodically.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us by opening an issue on our GitHub repository.</p>
